    <h2>Review: Basketball Dog (2018)</h2>
    <p><i>4 out of 5 stars</i></p>
    <p>From director <b>Vicki Fleming</b> comes the heartwarming tale of a boy named Pete (Trent Dugson) and his dog Rover (voiced by Brinson Lumblebrunt). You may think a boy and his dog learning the true value of friendship sounds familiar, but a big twist sets this flick apart: Rover plays basketball, and he's doggone good at it.</p>
    <p>This movie has everything you could ask for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Basketball</li>
        <li>A dog</li>
        <li>Nail-biting suspense</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While it may not have been necessary to include all 150 minutes of Rover's championship game in real time, Basketball Dog will keep your interest for the entirety of its 4-hour runtime, and the end will have any dog lover in tears. If you love basketball or sports pets, this is the movie for you.</p>
    <p>Find the full cast listing at the Basketball Dog website.</p>
